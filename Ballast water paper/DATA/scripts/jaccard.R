#' Calculate the Jaccard index between two Raster objects.
#'
#' The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between sample sets, and is 
#' defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of 
#' the sample sets. Function assumes that values in rasters being compared
#' have values [0, 1] (other behaviour is not defined), such as rank rasters
#' produced by Zonation. 
#'
#' Specific parts of rasters can compared by using the threshhold argument.
#' For example, if threshhold is set to 0.9, the overlaps of pixels with 
#' values >= 0.9 are compared. In Zonation terms this translates into comparing
#' the best 10% of the landscape in both solutions.
#'
#' @param raster1 first raster to be compared
#' @param raster2 second raster to be compared
#' @param threshhold double value ([0, 1]) defining which fraction of the landscape is compared
#' @param warn.uneven boolean conrolling whether a waringn is raised if the fractions of landscape in different rasters are very uneven
#'
#' @return a double value defining the Jaccard index
